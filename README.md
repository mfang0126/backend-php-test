# Php-test-frontend

## Project Description

This application is the frontend focus, is for Task 6.
Due to the time, I don't have time to implement the JWT and login.

It is able to run alongside with the backend api.

### Production version file location 
```
frontend/dist/index.html
```


### PHP Instruction
Go to backend folder
```
php -S localhost:1337 -t web/ web/index.php
```

npm run serve
```

You also can run commands below or using apache for both.
